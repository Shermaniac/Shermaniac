# Hello there! üëã

I am a full believer in open source. It's the bedrock of innovation and collaboration; it's how we all push the boundary on what is possible. That is why I am proud to support open-source projects empowering creators, developers, and dreamers everywhere.

I'm starting a directory of the open-source projects I support and contribute to in personal capacity, knowing full well that technology thrives when we work with each other. Let's keep building, sharing, and pushing forward‚Äîtogether.
